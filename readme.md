### Microsoft Teams Assignments and other interesting codes

This repository will contain all code from Coding Ninjas Assignments and Microsoft Teams regular classes and other stuff I do and find interesting. 
All of this code is free to use, copy, modify and improve.

Please note that all code inside the 'wip' folder is still a work in progress and do not use any code inside that folder unless I ask you to. The code may cause problems that I'll not be responsible for and I may or may not be able to help you with.
